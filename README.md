# Python-Challenge

# PyBank
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  The total number of months included in the dataset;
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;
  Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes;
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period;
  The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period;
  The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
  
# PyPolls

  A complete list of candidates who received votes;
  The percentage of votes each candidate won;
  The total number of votes each candidate won;
  The winner of the election based on popular vote;
