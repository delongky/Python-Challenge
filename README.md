# Python-Challenge

# PyBank
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  The total number of months included in the dataset
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
  
# PyPolls
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  The total number of votes cast
  A complete list of candidates who received votes
  The percentage of votes each candidate won
  The total number of votes each candidate won
  The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
